# anomaly-detection-dual-score
This repository explores dual scoring in anomaly detection, integrating local (context-sensitive) and global (dataset-wide) scores to enhance anomaly identification. It investigates their interplay, advantages, and integration strategies, with experiments evaluating effectiveness in applications like finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity.
